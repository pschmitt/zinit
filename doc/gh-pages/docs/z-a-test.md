## Introduction

Zinit extension that runs tests (via `make test`, for example) – if it finds
any of them  – after installing and updating a plugin or snippet. Simply load it
as a plugin to make it active:

```zsh
zinit light zinit-zsh/z-a-test
```

Example activation in the default quiet mode:

![z-a-test activation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zinit-zsh/z-a-test/master/images/z-p-test-1.png)


Example activation in non-quiet mode:

![z-a-test activation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zinit-zsh/z-a-test/master/images/z-p-test-2.png)

## Installation

Simply load as a plugin. This will install the extension within Zinit:

```zsh
zinit light zinit-zsh/z-a-test
```
