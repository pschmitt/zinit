This is the Zinit wiki, brought to you by [zdharma-continuum](https://github.com/zdharma-continuum). The goal is to complement the
[**README**](https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/zinit/blob/master/README.md) by providing
a more easy to approach, more intuitively organized (with help of the
[**MkDocs**](https://www.mkdocs.org/) project-documentation tool) and also a more
in-depth information.
